imap_growler
============

Notification of new, unread email using Ruby, Highline/Import, Net/IMAP, and ruby-growl.

Intially was built to monitor new GMail messages since I use the mutt mail client.  Should be pretty easy to change if you need to check any imap server though.

The authentication mechanism should be put in it's own definition, if you actually change it feel free to make the commit.
